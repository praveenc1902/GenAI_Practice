In comparison, our 15-year fixed-rate APR is 5.848%.\\n\\nAs you might have noticed, the APR for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is lower than the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. This is because the repayment period for a 15-year mortgage is half that of a 30-year mortgage, which means you'll pay off the loan in a shorter amount of time and pay less interest over the life of the loan. However, your monthly payments will be higher due to the shorter repayment term.\\n\\nThe choice between a 30-year and a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage depends on various factors such as your financial situation, budget, and long-term financial goals. We would be happy to discuss these options further with you and help you determine the best fit for your needs.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nLender Customer Support\""
