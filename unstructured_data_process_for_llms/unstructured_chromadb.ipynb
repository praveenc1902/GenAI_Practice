The observer’s eyes have told him that he has seen such\\nthings, and the verb “to see” is merely a compendious expression to\\nindicate that on the evidence of your eyes such or such a phenomenon has\\nactually occurred.

       "  'text': 'For High Alpine resorts in winter are a conjuring trick of a\\nglorious and luminous kind. Our commonsense, based on experience, tells\\nus that ice is cold, but is melted by heat; and that snow is wet; and\\nthat unless you put on a greatcoat when the thermometer registers frost,\\nyou will feel chilly; and that if you frequently fall down in the snow\\nyou will be wet through, and if you do not change your clothes when you\\nreturn home you will catch a cold. All these things are quite obvious,\\nand he who does not grant them as premises to whatever conclusion we may\\nhappen to base on them, is clearly not to be argued with, but soothed\\nand comforted like a child or taken care of like a lunatic. But High\\nAlpine winter resorts give, apparently, ocular disproof of all these\\nobvious statements, and those who go out to these delectable altitudes\\nin favourable seasons see (which is ocular evidence) every day and all\\nday the exact opposite of these primitively simple prepositions\\nregularly and continually taking place. They sit in the sun, when they\\nare tired of skating, and see that though a torrid luminary beats down\\non the frozen surface, burning and browning the faces of their friends,\\nthe ice remains perfectly dry and unmelted; they trudge through snow,\\nand find that they are not wet; they see the thermometer marking\\nanything up or down to thirty degrees of frost, and go out coatless and\\nvery likely hatless, and are conscious only of an agreeable and bracing\\nwarmth; they go ski-ing and all day are smothered in snow, and yet\\nreturn dry and warm and comfortable to their hotels, and do not catch\\nany cold whatever. Shakespeare once made an allusion of some kind (I\\ncannot look all through his plays to find it) about hot ice, meaning to\\nemploy a nonsensical expression. But it is the most striking testimonial\\nto the magnificence\\nof his brain that all he ever wrote meant something, although, as in\\nthis instance, he designed it not to. For without doubt he was alluding\\nto what appears to occur at St. Moritz or Mürren.',\n",

Even\\nwhen they were out in Switzerland they hardly believed what appeared to\\nbe happening, for they found that if the weather changed, and instead of\\nthe windless calm, or a light north-wind, the Föhn-wind blew from the\\nsouth-west, warm and enervating, then, in proportion as the thermometer\\nmounted, they felt increasingly cold.

They are clearly the victims of some\\nobscure but infectious derangement of the brain, of which the chief\\nsymptoms are those strange illusions and an immense appetite.... And, as\\nI have said, the victims of these illusions, before they have spent many\\ndays in England, are already themselves wondering whether all these\\nthings really were so, or whether they were but the fabric of a pleasing\\ndream. But they make plans to dream again about the middle of the\\nensuing autumn, and for the most part find that the vision is\\nrecapturable.

Certainly it\\nwould be hard to say that anything in the world is more beautiful than a\\nbeech-tree in spring, or a crimson rambler in full flower, or glimpses\\nof the Mediterranean in a frame of grey-green olive-trees; and I am\\ninclined to believe that it is partly the contrast which a sunny morning\\nin winter among the High Alps presents to all that a Londoner has known\\nor dreamed of hitherto that partly accounts for the ineffable\\nimpressions it never fails in producing on him. And to that we must add\\nthe exhilarating and invigorating effect of the still dry air, and the\\nsun that all day pours Pactolus over the gleaming fields. In such an air\\nand in such a flood of light all our senses and perceptions are\\nquickened, the vitality of our organs is increased, and with the\\nwonderful feeling of bien-être which the conditions give, our\\nappreciation is kindled too.

In such wise do\\nI fly from my conscience—conscience, I may remark, is one of the things\\nthat everybody leaves behind when he goes to the High Alps: apparently\\nit and other poisonous organisms, such as the bacillus of tuberculosis\\ncannot exist in those altitudes—while below my breath I again register\\nthe frequently broken vow that I will be at home again by the middle of\\nJanuary at the latest. For indeed it seems impossible to tolerate London\\nany longer just now: the fogs have begun (these are the excuses with\\nwhich I seek to stay the protests of conscience, before I fly from it),\\nand for three days last week we lived in a thick and ominous twilight of\\ndusky orange, tasting evilly of soot and sulphurous products. At\\nintervals a copper-coloured plate showed itself above the house roofs:\\nand, oh, to think that this mean metallic circle was indeed none other\\nthan the hot radiant giant that in the happier climes was rejoicing to\\nrun his course across the turquoise expanse of cloudless sky; that this\\nremote and meaningless object was the same that sparkled on dazzling\\npeak and precipice and turned the untrodden snows to sheets of diamond\\ndust. Then after three days of Stygian gloom the fog was dispersed by a\\nshrewd and shrill north wind, and for a whole morning snow fell heavily,\\nwhich, as it touched the pavements and roadways of town more than\\nusually befouled by the fog, turned into a\\nbase and degrading substance resembling melting coffee-ice. The streets\\nswam in the icy treacle of it, and motor-buses and other ponderous\\nvehicles cast undesired helpings of it at the legs of foot-passengers.\\nAfter this dispiriting day the weather changed again and a tepid\\nsouth-westerly gale squealed through the streets. This was too much: I\\nbought a quantity of what is known as sermon-paper and two new\\nstylographs (this was another sop to conscience, and implied the\\nintention of working out in Switzerland), made a few hasty and craven\\narrangements on the telephone, and slid out of Charing Cross Station at\\n2.20 P.M. precisely next day, leaving\\nconscience, like an abandoned wife, sobbing on the platform.',\n",

Whenever I arrive at Berne it\\nis always a grey chilly morning, just above freezing point, so that the\\nicy streets are half slush. At first this used to depress me with\\nominous forebodings of a thaw at the higher altitudes: now I know that\\nall the winter through it is always just thawing at Berne, and that the\\nsky there always is heavily be-clouded. I think a sunny frosty morning\\nthere would cause me some considerable anxiety, for it would imply a\\ncomplete upset of climatic conditions, and midsummer might\\nbe expected to hold its abhorred sway on the heights. So in perfect\\nequanimity I climb back again into our train—heated to the temperature\\nof the second hottest room in a Turkish bath—and we jog in more\\nleisurely fashion through the half-frozen villages towards the lake of\\nThun. These villages are mainly composed of houses taken from the\\nlarger-sized boxes of toys, with stones fastened down on their\\nwood-shingle eaves to prevent their roofs blowing away, and with\\nstaircases, clearly built for ornament, and completely unpractical,\\nclimbing up the outside of their walls. Stations and banks and hotels\\nseem to be constructed with a view to moderate permanence; the rest are\\nclearly so made that they can be taken up and planted down somewhere\\nelse. Then as we emerge on to the edges of the lake, higher hills begin\\nto tower across its steely-grey levels, and rifts in the clouds that\\nshroud their heads and hunched shoulders show glimpses of sun that shine\\non the whiteness of snow. Mile after mile we pursue a meandering way\\nalong the shores, and thread the darkness of hoarse tunnels, whose lips\\nare fringed with dripping icicles, and the sense of something coming,\\nsomething high and clear, begins to grow. Though in front, where\\nInterlaken lies, a veil of grey-blue mist is interspersed between us and\\nthat which, I know, soars above it, the clouds are beginning on all\\nsides to become unravelled like wool-work pulled out, and through the\\nrents and torn edges gleams of turquoise sky are seen. High up climb\\nserrated rims of rock, cut vividly clear against the blue and fringed\\nwith aspiring pines; higher yet, where the boldest of these brave\\nvegetables can find no footing, further ridges appear austere and empty\\nand gleaming. Yet these are but the outlying buttresses\\nand ramparts of the great towers at the base of which they lean and\\ncluster: to-night we shall sleep in an eyrie far above them, and far\\nabove us yet will watch the unscaled precipices of the great range, over\\nthe edge of which the unheeding stars climb and swim into sight all\\nnight long, pouring the golden dew of their shining upon forest and\\nglacier, until the snows are rosy with dawn.',\n",

In spring or summer or autumn\\nit is broken by sounds of cowbells\\nperhaps, and, almost certainly by a murmur of wind in pine-woods, or of\\nwater hurrying from the heights. But in winter, on a still evening those\\nevidences of life are dumb, and yet the silence itself is pregnant with\\nvitality. At sunset the high tops burn in rose-coloured flame, and as\\nthe glory fades into the toneless velvet of the frosty sky, the stars in\\ntheir wheeling are of a brilliance utterly unknown to lower altitudes,\\nexcept perhaps where the desert lies fallow and dry beneath Egyptian\\nskies, and no emanation from the earth dims the burning of these “patins\\nof bright gold.” But that “quiring to the bright-eyed Seraphim” reaches\\nnot the mortal ear, and at evening or at night in these High Alps, there\\nis felt, as it were, that ecstasy of silence that seems on the point of\\nbursting into chorus: “it must get rid of what it knows.” Nowhere else\\nhave I felt so rapturous a quality of stillness: the frozen snow lies\\ntaut under the grip of the immense energy of the frost: no avalanches\\nslipping from the snow-laden flanks of the Jungfrau under the hot beams\\nof the sun, startle the valley with sonorous thunder: the wind stirs not\\nthe lightest needle of the pines; the villagers are home from the frozen\\nfields, and doors are shut. Slowly the last rose-colour fades from the\\npeaks, and the stars brighten, and you hold your breath to hear the most\\nwonderful thing you have ever heard—utter stillness, that yet is\\nstrained almost to bursting point with the energies that make it, the\\npeace that passes understanding that lies above the snow and beneath the\\nstars....',\n",

It suddenly strikes the writer that the inexperienced in these\\nmatters will have concluded that I mean that when once those\\nfrost-flowers have formed all skating is over, and that if they have\\ngone to Switzerland for the indulgence of this taste, all that is\\nhenceforth to be offered them is the opportunity to admire this frozen\\nvegetation instead of cutting figures. I therefore hasten to assure them\\nthat lake skating in Switzerland does not count; indeed most\\nwinter resorts have no lake at all; and even if they have, skating there\\nis quite the exception and not the rule. In nine cases out of ten the\\nsnow spoils the ice before it bears, and the frost-flowers spoil the\\ngreater part of it, even if the snow has held off, almost immediately\\nafterwards. Lake-skating, in fact, is of the nature of a bonus rather\\nthan a dividend: to be enjoyed if it happens, but by no means to be\\nreckoned on.',\n",

The construction and\\nrenovation of these rinks is most interesting, and ranks among the fine\\narts, just as does the architecture of a fine golf-links or the\\npreparation of good wickets. These rinks are used for two purposes:\\nskating, including bandy or ice hockey, and curling. I do not count\\nice-gymkhanas or ice-carnivals, because anything is good enough for\\nthem. You can play the shovel-game or crawl through barrels among the\\njungles of frost-flowers.

Up and down they go, in\\nslow time, stamping heavily with their great feet, and making out of\\nperhaps a foot of snow some 3 or 4 inches at the most, of really compact\\nand hard foundation. It will resemble at the best, as regards evenness,\\na lane over which flocks of ponderous sheep have passed; but the\\ngroundwork (this is the main point) will be of hardened snow, though\\nextremely rough of surface. Then they may all sit down and smoke their\\npipes again—all, that is, except the headman and those who pull about,\\nat his bidding, the yards of hose which at one end terminate in a brass\\nnozzle, at the other in the water-supply, which should run in the main\\nat high pressure. This water is then turned on to the compacted snow\\nwhich gets soaked with it, and, if a few nights of hard frost follow the\\noriginal snowfall, becomes gradually converted into a sort of rough but\\nglazed and solid ice. Then, if nothing untoward happens, in the shape of\\nthaw or further snowfall, the next step is taken. But if there is during\\nthese few days a thaw, they have to wait for more snow to fall, and do\\ntheir trampling over again; while if there is more snow, the poor\\nwretches have still to trample and get the foundations firm again. But\\nif all goes well—and the experienced iceman will delay the original\\ntrampling until the barometer or his weather-sense (preferably the\\nformer) promises cold weather to follow—he makes his second operation.\\nHe will have built a small bank of snow perhaps 3 feet high and\\nwell-spaded down, round his rink, and have sprinkled that as well as his\\nrink surface, so that it is at any rate glazed with ice and water-tight.\\nThen, waiting for a bright sunny morning, he floods the whole rink with\\nperhaps 2 inches of water. The sunniness of the day is most important\\nfor this operation: if he put on this flood on a cold day, or at evening\\nwhen a frosty night was imminent, all the water he put on, lying on the\\ncold frozen surface below, and with the frosty air above it would freeze\\nsolid without cohering to the original frozen foundation. But putting it\\non while the sun is hot, the top surface of the foundation is percolated\\nwith the flood, and when the frost of the night follows, the flood binds\\nwith it. One night possibly may not consolidate the flood: if it does\\nnot, he waits till another night completes the work. All the time, it\\nmust be remembered, the rink presents the most depressing appearance:\\nlittle bits of frozen snow have floated up to the surface, frost-flowers\\nperhaps have made their ill-starred appearance, and it still somewhat\\nresembles a sheep-trampled lane. But then things begin to look better:\\nand another inch of water is put on, and then another inch, and then\\nanother, each being consolidated before the next is applied, and each\\nbeing applied not in the evening, but when the sun will slightly melt\\nthe previous surface. With each of these floodings the ice grows more\\ndesirably smooth, and more immaculately clean, till at the end of\\nperhaps a fortnight there\\nis something like 18 inches of solid ice over the ground that was\\nlevelled in the spring. At least this thickness is required if the ice\\nis to last properly, for even in mid-winter the most sickening series of\\nclimatic catastrophes may occur, which, unless there is good thickness\\nof ice originally built up, may spoil the rink altogether. For on hot\\nsunny days, though the surface of the ice remains quite dry, very great\\nevaporation occurs, and the dryness of the air drinks up the melted ice\\nbefore it visibly or tangibly becomes water. Or again, even in the most\\nwell-conducted winters, at the most approved resorts, there may be a\\ncomplete thaw, and “the pools are filled with water,” which also\\nevaporates. In both these cases, there is a consequent loss of ice, and\\nthe bullion, so to speak, must be able to stand the drain upon it. Still\\nworse, there may be a snowfall followed by a thaw, followed by a frost.\\nThe thaw has eaten into the ice; the frost has caused this rodent\\nmixture to get encrusted again. And then, if there is not good depth of\\nice, the most excruciating events tread on each others’ heels. The\\nground below the thin ice is warmed with the penetrating sun, and begins\\nto exude bubbles; the bubbles rise, and horrible water-blisters, skinned\\nover with ice, appear. The skates crash through them (“and langwedge\\nwhich I will not pollewt my pen with describing,” as Miss Fanny Squeers\\nsaid) and cut into the half-frozen ground, which thereupon begins to\\nleak.

For, as I have said, the flood must be put on while the\\nsun is still on the ice, to enable it to bind into the ice already\\nformed, and thus hours of daylight are lost to the skater. Furthermore,\\nunless a really severe night follows, it will not be all properly\\nfrozen. So the good ice-maker, instead of turning skaters off the ice,\\nand getting by one flood sufficient thickness to last for three or four\\ndays more,\\nsprinkles instead. This is a far longer and more troublesome process,\\nfor with his hose-pipe with its small nozzle he has to go over the ice\\nagain and again, six or seven times perhaps, or more, in a single night,\\nif ice is badly wanted.

Certainly also a\\nflood of a couple of inches frozen solid is far more brittle in itself\\nthan ice built up in thin layers, and an awkward toe-strike with the tip\\nof the skate will cut a great chunk out of flood-ice, whereas it makes\\nfar less impression on sprinkled ice.

But in all other games (and this is where skating differs from\\nthem all) the point is to achieve a certain object, and the achievement\\nof that object, however attained, renders the achiever a notable\\nperformer if he consistently attains it. The golfer, for instance, who\\nconsistently drives a long straight ball, puts his mashie shot near the\\nhole, and generally putts out, is a magnificent golfer, in whatever\\nmanner or style he executes these tyrannously difficult feats. There are\\na hundred and a hundred hundred styles and modes of putting, and they\\nare all good, provided only they enable the putter to hole his ball. At\\ncricket, similarly, a man may bowl fast or slow with any sort of break,\\nand with any sort of action (provided his shirt sleeve is not wantonly\\nflapping), and he is a good bowler if only he gets wickets cheaply. But\\nat skating the prescribed thing has to be done in the prescribed manner,\\nand the prescriptions of the English school are, broadly speaking, all\\nof them diametrically opposed to the principles of the International\\nschool. In the English style the employed leg (i.e. the one\\nwhich for the moment is being skated on) must be straight; in the\\nInternational style it must be bent. In the English style the unemployed\\nleg must be close to the other, and hang beside it, loosely and easily;\\nin the International, wherever the exigencies of\\nthe movement demand that it should be, it must at any rate never be\\nthere. In English the arms must not be spread and swung abroad to assist\\nthe movement, but must be carried inactively by the side, whereas in\\nInternational, as long as the skate moves the arms must be engaged on\\ntheir assigned activity. In both schools, in fact, every movement must\\nbe executed in a given way, but in no case is there the smallest\\nresemblance between those ways, though both should result in clean edges\\nand clean turns executed at defined places.',\n",

       "  'text': 'It is not my intention to give here a manual of English skating,\\nbeginning with instruction to beginners and ending with timorous hints\\nto experts, but any book on Winter Sports would necessarily be\\nincomplete unless it babbled to some considerable extent about skating,\\nwhich, without doubt, is the sport in pursuit of which the large\\nmajority of English folk visit the High Alps in winter. From whatever\\ncause, this slippery art exercises a unique spell over the able-bodied\\nand athletic section of Anglo-Saxon mankind. It may be that this is\\npartly accounted for by the comparative rarity of the occasions on which\\nwe can skate, owing to our Gulf-Stream-beridden and generally\\npestilential climate, and it is sufficient that some puddle-place in a\\nvillage green should be half-frozen to cause the majority, not only of\\nyouth but of sedate men and women, to hurry down to the spot, and there\\nslide about on both feet with staggerings and frequent falls and the\\never-present possibility of occasional immersions. But the rarity of\\neven half-frozen puddles in England does not wholly account for the\\ntranscendent spell: there is something in the\\nquality of motion which is started by a stroke of the tense muscles, and\\nthen continues of its own accord, without effort or friction, until the\\nimpetus is exhausted, that appeals to our unwinged race, who must\\notherwise keep putting foot before foot to get anywhere. The sensation\\nitself is exquisite, and the sensation is rendered more precious by the\\nfact that from the days when the tyro slides cautiously forward on both\\nfeet, to the days when, having become a master in his art, he executes\\nback-counters at the centre in a combined figure, there is always a\\nslight uncertainty as to what is going to happen next. The tyro\\nrejoicing in the unaccustomed method of progress is conscious of a\\npleasing terror as to whether he will not fall flat down, and glows with\\ncallow raptures all the time that he does not; while the finest skater\\nwho ever lived, will never be quite sure that he will flick out his\\nback-counter cleanly and unswervingly. We can all walk pretty\\nperfectly—at least, there is no pleasing terror that we may be going to\\nfall down—but none of us at our respective levels as artists in skating\\ncan skate pretty perfectly. We can only skate moderately well,\\nconsidering how well we can skate. And the joy of it! The unreasoning,\\ndelirious joy of the beginner who for the first time feels his outside\\nedge bite the ice, and, no less, the secret elation of the finest\\nperformers in the world, when they execute their back-counter close to\\nthe centre, at high speed, and without the semblance of flatness in the\\nedge! And even if any of us was so proficient as to perform such a feat\\nwith absolute certainty, there is no doubt whatever that we should find\\nsome further feat that would put us back into the dignified ranks\\nof\\nstragglers again. And the same holds good with regard to International\\nskating: at least if there is any among those delightful artists who\\nwill execute the Hugel star first on one foot and then on the other\\nwithout a pleasing anxiety gnawing at his heart, I should very much like\\nto know his name and black his boots for him.',\n",

He must be standing erect with his shoulders and body\\nsideways to the direction of his curve, not facing square down it.\\nIn other words, he must, among other things, be travelling not further\\nforward than on the middle of his skate, otherwise he will not be\\nstanding erect, but leaning forward. This attitude is that which is\\nreferred to, in the humorous book I have already quoted, as\\ncharacteristic of the ramrod school. But the author, in his blissful\\nignorance of skating matters, is not aware that it is impossible\\nto execute a long smooth circumference of curve if you progress on the\\nforepart of your skate. If you are on the forepart of the skate, you\\nmust be leaning forward, and no one of known anatomy can lean forward\\nand execute a long smooth edge. The balance is unsteady, and the edge\\nwobbles. Commonsense, then, again endorses this rule. In order to be\\nsteady on a long edge, your balance must be of the established order.\\nYou must be upright, and travelling without muscular effort to retain\\nyour position. This is only attained by travelling on the middle or the\\naft part of the skate. For nobody can stand still on their toes. But\\nstanding on the middle part of the foot or with the weight on the heel\\nit is perfectly easy to do so. But when this humorous author (whom I\\ndrag out of his obscurity for the last time) calls this the ramrod\\nschool, he proves himself ignorant of the first principles of English\\nskating, or perhaps has only observed himself in some mirror at Prince’s\\nClub attempting to assume the correct attitude himself. As a matter of\\nfact, the proper attitude of the skater in the English style is exactly\\nthat of a man who is well made and master of his limbs standing still\\nwith the weight chiefly on one foot. While skating, it is true, the\\nweight is entirely on one foot, and the performer is moving, and not\\nstanding still. But the pose necessary to smooth and swift progression\\nis exactly that. It no more resembles a ramrod, when decently done, as\\nevery good English skater does it, than it resembles a coal-scuttle or a\\npince-nez, or what you will.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Here, it will be seen, the test begins with a combined figure. The\\nwhole subject of combined figures will be treated of separately, and\\nfor the present we need only remark that this is a very simple one. Then\\nfollow the inside back edge, which, as I have said, is the most\\ndifficult of the edges, skated larger than before, in curves of 20 feet,\\nand the cross-stroke on the outside back. This means that the stroke is\\ntaken with the feet crossing, the one that is taking the stroke being\\ncrossed behind the other. As a matter of fact, this stroke, which at one\\ntime played a considerable part in English skating, since in combined\\nfigures all strokes from outside back to outside back were bound to be\\ntaken from the crossing position, is now not obligatory. But it is a\\npretty stroke in itself, and necessitates the skate being placed on the\\nice on the edge. Then follow the two forward turns, skated rather large,\\nin order to begin to familiarise the learner with the feeling of turns\\ntaken at a high speed. This necessitates clean skating of the turn\\nitself, since if a turn is skated fast, and not clean, it is quite\\npossible that the skater may fall, and he will in any case make a blur\\ninstead of a sharp cut turn. Also these turns teach him to hold his\\nedges out after the turn, the tendency being to let the body rotate,\\nwhereby the curve curls in, and the skater soon finds himself in a\\nposition that it is impossible to maintain. But if he skates his turn,\\nand then can hold an edge for 50 feet away from it afterwards,\\nhe may congratulate himself on the fact that he is beginning to skate\\nhis edges big and in the proper style. For these cannot, practically\\nspeaking, be held out, unless the rules for position are being conformed\\nwith. Then follow four simple figures of the class known as 8’s, of\\nwhich the simplest is that required in the third-class test, namely, an\\noutside forward 8. All 8’s, as their name denotes, are of the same\\ngeneral shape, i.e. the shape implied by\\ntheir name, but between the edges that trace the shape of the 8, the\\nskater is now required to put in certain turns. He starts, for instance,\\non an outside forward edge, when half round his circle makes a three\\nturn, and comes back to his centre on the inside back edge. Or he starts\\non an inside forward edge as in the third 8, and has to make two turns\\nbefore he arrives at his centre again, which he reaches as an inside\\nforward edge. Or, more searchingly, he has to start his 8 on an outside\\nback edge, and make two turns and aim at his centre again on an outside\\nback edge.',\n",

What is meant is\\nthat he has now run up against the really crucial difficulties in\\nEnglish skating, of which perhaps the greatest of all is to stand still,\\nas the Irishman might say, while moving rapidly. As will be already seen\\nin this test, he is required to do this for somewhat extensive travel:\\nin his outside forward turn, for\\ninstance, he has to proceed for at least fifty feet on his forward edge\\nbefore making his turn, and the same distance on his back edge after\\nmaking his turn. And though this present disquisition is intended to be\\na statement of English skating and not a book of instruction, the writer\\ncannot bear to let this one opportunity slip of giving just one hint. It\\nis perfectly impossible to travel steadily for distances like these—and\\nthe skater will have to learn to go much further yet on his edges—if he\\nis travelling on the forepart of his skate. All forward turns, by the\\nslight check they give to the speed (I am not now talking of those ideal\\nskaters who actually get speed out of a turn), tend to put the skater\\nfurther forward on his skate. He must therefore approach all forward\\nturns on the back part of his skate, so that by this tendency to rock\\nforward he will make the turn itself on about the middle of the skate.\\nNever for a moment, if he can help it, must he get on the toe of his\\nskate, and if ever he does, he must regain position again by leaning\\nfearlessly back. And in this second test, he will find that the\\ndifficulty of travelling well back on his skate is at first appalling.\\nBut having learned that, and learned it thoroughly, he will probably not\\ncome across any subsequent requirement which appears to him so clearly\\nimpossible.',\n",

Finally, if he is still in want of\\nmarks, he may earn a few more by a grape-vine.

A good\\nEnglish skater will put down his turns and edges one over the other, in\\nthe accurate fashion so rightly demanded by the International style,\\nwithout producing half the effect that a good International skater will\\nproduce. But the English skater has done the more difficult feat. On the\\nother hand, I do not think that\\nthe skater in the English style is ever called upon to do anything so\\ndifficult in his highest test as the back-loop 8, or perhaps the rocker\\n8, as required by the first-class International test. And then I think\\nof a back bracket, executed at good speed at a certain point, in the\\ncorrect style. Really I do not know.... Also I do not care. The\\nback-loop 8 of the International skater is altogether lovely, which is\\nall that matters.',\n",

It contains more of the material for skating than does the\\ncorresponding English second test, in which only the four edges, the\\nfour simple turns, and the four changes of edge are introduced, since\\nthis International second test comprises as well as those, the four\\nloops, and two out of the four brackets. These\\nloops, which are most charming and effective figures, have nowadays no\\nplace in English skating, since it is quite impossible to execute any of\\nthem, as far as is at present known, without breaking the rules for\\nEnglish skating, since the unemployed leg (i.e. the one not\\ntracing the figure) must be used to get the necessary balance and swing.\\nThey belong to a great class of figures like cross-cuts in all their\\nvarieties, beaks, pigs-ears, &c., in which the skater nearly, or\\nactually, stops still for a moment, and then, by a swing of the body or\\nleg, resumes or reverses his movement. By this momentary loss and\\nrecovery of balance there is opened out to the skater whole new fields\\nof intricate and delightful movements, and the patterns that can be\\ntraced on the ice are of endless variety. And here in this second\\nInternational test the confines of this territory are entered on by the\\nfour loops, which are the simplest of the “check and recovery” figures.\\nIn the loops (the shape of which is accurately expressed by their names)\\nthe skater does not come absolutely to a standstill, though very nearly,\\nand the swing of the body and leg is then thrown forward in front of the\\nskate, and this restores to it its velocity, and pulls it, so to speak,\\nout of its loop. A further extension of this check and resumption of\\nspeed occurs in cross-cuts, which do not enter into the International\\ntests, but which figure largely in the performance of good skaters. Here\\nthe forward movement of the skate (or backward movement, if back\\ncross-cuts are being skated) is entirely checked, the skater comes to a\\nmomentary standstill and moves backwards for a second. Then the forward\\nswing of the body and unemployed leg gives him back his checked and\\nreversed movement.',\n",

A\\ngood programme will contain dozens of turns and changes of edge, all\\nmelting into each other without break or pause. None who have seen the\\nfree skating of a fine performer can ever forget or question the\\nbrilliance and variety of this three-minute free skating. As likely as\\nnot, he will make his entry on to the rink in a spiral edge, and before\\nit has come to rest at the centre, start off on his coruscating\\nperformance. Rockers, brackets, counters, and turns succeed each other\\nwith bewildering rapidity; and all are performed with the utmost ease\\nand grace. It seems impossible to tell where the motive-power comes\\nfrom, so smooth and effortless is the travelling; you would have said\\nthe skater was wafted by some localised wind, or impelled by some\\ninvisible mechanism.

Epicure though the skater\\nis, with regard to the smoothness and levelness of his ice, the curler,\\nquite rightly, is even more exigent, and slight slopes of surface and\\nminute inequalities and roughnesses which do not interfere with the\\nskater at all, make it impossible for the curler to have a satisfactory\\nrink. In any case, the curler’s portion must be roped off from the\\nskating part of the rink, for, naturally, no skate blade must make the\\nsmallest scratch on his sacred enclosure; while, on the other side, the\\ncurler is liable, in the ecstasies of his “sooping,” to shed and scatter\\npieces of broom which wander on to the skater’s ice and cause falls.\\nBesides, the skip habitually shouts at the top of his voice, and a good\\nstone evokes choruses of open-throated music: thus, if many curlers are\\nshouting at the top of their voices, combined skaters cannot hear the\\ncaller, unless he shouts at the top of his voice. If he does this while\\nskating a figure, he will speedily become purple in the face and quite\\nbreathless. Also, the curler smokes when he curls, which tempts the\\nskater to do likewise, and for the sake of the rink he must not. For\\nthose and many other reasons, the curler should, when possible, have\\na\\nseparate rink of his own, where he can soop and shout and smoke without\\ninterfering with anybody.',\n",

This is done by means of a lath or strip of wood with two nails\\nor steel points projecting from the lower face, 7 feet apart. Inserting\\none of these in the centre you pull the lath round, so that the other\\nscratches on the ice a circumference at a distance of 7 feet. As stated\\nin Rule 2, “additional circles” may also be drawn. These circles are\\ndrawn from the same centre, with a radius of 2½ and 4 feet respectively\\nfrom it. This is done for convenience in measuring the distance from the\\ntee of stones lying within the 7-foot radius, as it gives additional\\nlines of measurement. This whole system of circles with the central tee\\nis called “the house,” and, as we shall see, all stones which, after\\nbeing played, have come to rest with any part of them lying within the\\nhouse, may add to the score of the side which has projected them there.\\nBehind the house, in the position specified in Rule 3, is placed the\\ncrampit. This is a strip of iron long enough for the player to stand on\\nwith one foot in advance of the other. It is roughened with spikes on\\nits lower side, so that it maintains a firm position on the ice, and at\\nthe back of it is a ridge against which the player places his right foot\\nbefore delivering the stones. It forms, in fact, a firm base for playing\\nfrom, since, if anybody attempted to put down a curling-stone, while\\nstanding on the ice itself, with sufficient velocity to make it slide\\nover the 42 yards to the other tee, he would quite certainly slip and\\nput himself down instead. It is from a crampit that almost all curlers\\nnowadays play. As an alternative they may use what is in the rule called\\na “hack,” which is a small iron contrivance fixed to the boot, and which\\nanswers the same\\npurpose as a crampit. But it is not, in Switzerland anyhow, often seen,\\nfor it requires adjustment for each individual player, whereas the\\ncrampit fits all alike.',\n",

But, strangely enough, it is nowhere laid\\ndown what the breadth of a rink should be. Somewhat pathetically this\\nrule presupposes that there is always “swept snow” at the side of the\\nrink, which, happily, is not the case. As a matter of fact the space\\nallowed for each rink is, roughly speaking, about 20 feet, though I am\\nnot aware that it is laid\\ndown authoritatively anywhere. In any case a stone, to be of the\\nslightest use, must be lying not so wide as 10 feet (lateral\\nmeasurement) from the tee, and those lying wider, as well as those which\\nhave definitely passed beyond the back-score, cannot conceivedly come\\ninto play, and so may as well be removed. But the case is different with\\nstones lying short of the hog-score, and in a straight line between the\\ntees. Such stones, as will be readily understood, might possibly be of\\nthe utmost value to guard other stones lying in the house, and perhaps\\nto be promoted into possible scorers. A guard, then, which is so\\nimportant an item, must be put down with some skill, and with requisite\\nstrength, and thus it is laid down that stones lying short of the hog\\nare considered not to have been sufficiently skilfully played to take\\npart in the game and be of value to their side.

And the\\nfirst consideration is the stance which the player takes up on the\\ncrampit before delivering his stone. Here, as at golf, there are\\ngreat varieties of stance, all of which are perfectly right and proper,\\nprovided the curler can deliver his stone from them with effect. But, as\\nat golf also, there are certain principles that will be found common to\\nall those stances, and perhaps the most important of all is that the\\ncurler should feel perfectly comfortable and be maintaining his stance\\nby balance and not by muscular effort. In every case again (if\\nhe be right-handed) his right foot will be firmly resting against the\\nrim at the back of the crampit, for it is there that he gets the\\npurchase which enables him to give the needful velocity to his stone.\\nSimilarly, his left foot will be advanced, and he will be facing full in\\nthe direction in which he is about to send his stone, and his left foot\\nwill also be pointing in that direction. He will also be bending down,\\nsince he has not to drop or fling the stone on to the ice, but to place\\nit—to lay it there smoothly with a forward swing of his arm and body.\\nBut any kind of divergence is proper as regards this stooping attitude:\\nsome men get their stone down to the ice by bending the body strongly\\nabove the hips, keeping the legs comparatively straight, while others\\nget down by bending the knees so far that they are sitting on their\\nright heel, and their right knee is absolutely touching the crampit. And\\nall these styles are perfectly right provided only that (i) the player\\nfeels comfortable and unstrained; (ii) he can get his stone well down on\\nto the ice; (iii) his head is facing and his eyes looking in the\\ndirection of his skip’s besom. All three of these provisions are\\nessential to successful curling, and if one thing can be more essential\\nthan another, it is that the player should be looking straight at the\\nskip’s besom.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Now there is a very important item in the swing at golf called the\\n“follow-through.” This means that after the ball has been hit and is on\\nits way, the club and the hands and arms holding it fly out after it,\\nwhile the whole weight of the body goes on to the left foot. There is no\\nquestion that what happens to the club and the arm and player generally,\\nafter the ball has gone, cannot make the least difference to the flight\\nof the ball, but this “follow-through” is a symptom, an indication of\\nwhat has already taken place, and if the follow-through is satisfactory\\nand full it shows that the swing has been unchecked and smooth. Just in\\nthe same way the curler has to follow through, and though no doubt both\\ncurler and golfer can, theoretically, check their swing the moment after\\nthe stone and the ball have started, they would be most ill-advised to\\nattempt to do so, since they run a grave risk of checking their swings\\nbefore the stone or the ball have gone, and thus giving to their shot\\nonly a fraction of the force of the swing. So the curler is strongly\\nadvised to let this forward swing of his arm and body work itself out in\\nthe natural follow-through. And this follow-through may express itself\\nin various ways. Most curlers express it by letting themselves run or\\nslide a few steps after their stone, the forward swing of the body\\noverbalancing their left foot, so that they instinctively (for fear they\\nshould fall down) put the right foot in front of it—in other words, take\\na few steps. Others again, and chiefly those who deliver the stone with\\nright leg very\\nstrongly bent, so that the knee touches or nearly touches the ice, have\\nnot time to scramble to their feet, and usually express their\\nfollow-through by falling forward on their hands on to the ice. But in\\nwhatever way they conduct themselves, this little run and slide which\\nsome take and the falling forward of others are the result of the\\nplayer’s proper and correct follow-through. He has not, at any rate,\\ninterfered with or checked his swing: he has delivered his stone with\\nthe force that he believed to be required.',\n",

This “handle” gives a rotatory motion to the stone, so that as\\nit is travelling up the ice it is also slowly revolving on its own axis,\\neither from right to left or left to right, and this rotation imparts to\\nit, as its initial velocity diminishes and its pace slows down, a\\ncurling movement, in the manner of a break from the off or a break from\\nthe leg at cricket, or, if you will, a swerve in the air, or, as in\\ngolf, of a pull or a slice. Thus, though a stone on the tee may be\\ncompletely guarded and covered, the player can, by imparting this\\nrotatory movement to his stone, curl round the guard and reach his goal.\\nMoreover, he can curl round the straight guard from either side, from\\nthe leg or from the off, so that if one path is blocked by another\\nguard, he may yet get access by the other. He can, too, if there is, as\\noften happens, a slight bias in the ice, apply the handle opposite to\\nthe direction in which the bias of the ice would deflect his shot, and\\nthus keep his stone straight. Or again, by aiding the bias by the other\\nhandle, he can get round a very wide obstacle indeed.\\nHeaven knows that these shots so glibly recorded are not easy; but there\\nis hardly a shot or a manœuvre in any game which is easy. But the man\\nwho aspires to be a curler at all must have a fair command of this thing\\ncalled “handle.” He must be able to direct a shot with moderate accuracy\\non the skip’s besom with either out-handle or in-handle. It is not\\nenough equipment for the most modest player, who is a curler at all, to\\nbe able to play with one handle only. He must have a tolerable command\\nof both.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Now, strange as it may at first appear, it is far easier to send down\\na stone with in-handle or out-handle on it than to send down a perfectly\\nstraight stone with no handle at all. Furthermore, the slightest frozen\\nchip of ice, or minutest fragment of broom may, in passing under one\\nside of the stone, impart a fortuitous and rotatory motion to it, so\\nthat a stone arriving in the house with practically no curl at all upon\\nit is (except in the case of a fast hard stone) a rarity. Since, then,\\nit is almost bound to have some handle on it, it is wiser for the player\\nto put on the handle himself intentionally and allow for its curling\\ncourse. This rotatory motion of the stone is imparted to it by a very\\nslight turn of the arm just before the stone leaves the hand. If the\\nelbow is turned outwards, it is called “out-elbow” or “out-handle,”\\nthough I am inclined to think that it is the wrist which makes the turn\\n(some people say the fingers alone), the elbow merely following the\\nwrist. This gives the stone a twist from right to left, and the effect\\nof it is that it curls in from the right in the manner of a ball bowled\\nwith leg-break. This out-handle curl is easily imparted to the stone by\\nturning the handle of it, as the hand grasps it, outwards at\\nright angles or thereabouts to the direction of the stone’s travelling,\\nand by holding the handle “overhand,” as it were, with the knuckles and\\nback of the hand facing the ice in front. The curl is then naturally\\nimparted to it, and the player will not have to think about it at all.\\nIf he delivers his stone in this way his wrist, if he holds his arm\\nslack, as he always should (giving the velocity to the stone only by the\\nswing), will naturally and inevitably make the outward turn. And it is a\\nmost important thing that the player should not think of handle at all\\nwhen he delivers his stone, but leave that to develop automatically from\\nthe correct delivery, since the consideration of the pace and direction\\nof the stone are enough to fill the most capacious mind and tax the\\nutmost of his skill. How much allowance should be made for the curl, and\\nhow much the stone should be aimed to the right of where it is desired\\nthat it should come to rest, is a matter which is largely left to the\\njudgment of the skip, who has been observing how much curl the ice\\ntakes. This differs very considerably, and depends on the condition of\\nthe surface. For instance, if the ice is very slow, a stone dies\\nquickly, and since the curl does not begin to take effect till the\\ninitial speed has very much diminished, it will not curl for so long as\\nit would on keen ice. On slow ice, in other words, the course of the\\nstone is less influenced by handle. But again, the vigorous polishing of\\nthe ice in front of a stone tends to keep it straight, since then the\\nroughnesses of the ice, on which the rotatory motion bites, are much\\ndiminished. But as a rule, after a few stones have been sent down, it is\\nclear to a good skip how much handle they are taking, and he directs\\naccordingly.',\n",

But often during the course of a match the character of the\\nice will change, and it will begin to take the handle more or less as\\nthe case may be. Both skip and individual players should be on the\\nlookout for this, and the tactics should be altered accordingly.

It so happened that I\\nwas the last to go, and for two minutes I waited at the head of the\\ntrack in a stillness that is unimaginable.

Far below, distant and dim, I could see the lights of Klosters,\\nand half-longed to reach them, in order to get out of this awful and\\nburning and frozen solitude, half-longed that my travel might be\\nlengthened into an eternity of wheeling stars and flying road. Sometimes\\nit seemed that I was rushing headlong through space, sometimes it seemed\\nthat I was stopping absolutely still, and that it was this unreal world\\nof trees and road and bridges and banks that hurled itself by me, and\\nthat the stars and I were the steadfast things. Once the sudden roar of\\na stream over the bridge of which I passed sounded loud and menacing,\\nbut in a moment that was past, and the hissing spray of frozen snow\\ncoming from the bows of my toboggan was the only sound audible.

       "  'text': 'Some idea of the speed at which toboggans travel on the straight\\nreaches of the course may be gathered from the average speed at which\\nthe course can be run. It is over 1300 yards in length, and has been\\ntraversed in a shade over 60 seconds! This means that the highest rate\\nof speed must be well over 70 miles an hour. This on a pair of steel\\nrunners, head foremost, with your face a few inches above the solid ice,\\nwith nothing to check you except a small-toothed rake on the toe of each\\nboot! Yet so wonderfully skilful is the construction of the run, so\\ncunningly is it built to safeguard the headlong traveller, that\\naccidents are very few. Two fatal ones, indeed, there have been, but of\\nthese one had nothing to do with the course itself, but was owing to the\\nfact that a rider started from the top before one of the\\nbarriers across the course, which show that it is not open for racing,\\nhad been removed. In the other, the rider ran over a bank and his\\ntoboggan fell on the top of him. One of the great difficulties which the\\nbuilders and managers of this run, in company with other ice-runs, have\\nto contend against, is the power of the sun. It is, of course,\\nabsolutely necessary that the icing of the run should be so solid that\\nthere is no chance of the runner of a toboggan going through it, which\\nwould naturally mean a bad spill. But it is also necessary that certain\\nof the banks must have the sun blazing into them all day long, which\\nwould cause them to lose ice faster than it could be made by the\\nsprinkling which goes on when the sun is off them. At such points,\\ntherefore, big canvas screens are put up, which shade the bank from the\\ndirect rays; also tobogganing is never permitted to go on all day. It\\nstarts early in the morning, when the run has been recuperated by the\\nnight of frost, and is closed when, in the opinion of the management,\\nthe sun has so softened the banks that there is danger of a toboggan\\ncutting through the crust.',\n",

       "  'text': 'This charming form of the sport may be described as combined\\ntobogganing, and in bobbing races teams of four enter against each\\nother. The form of toboggan used is, of course, immensely larger than\\nthat employed in single tobogganing, since it will hold five or six\\npersons, and its construction is altogether different and most\\nelaborate. It consists of a long, low platform some\\n10 feet in length, and is mounted, not on one pair of runners, but on\\ntwo. The pair that supports the fore part of the bobsleigh is a sort of\\nbogie-truck, pivoted under the platform, and it can be turned to the\\nright and left in order to direct the course of the bob round curves.\\nThis turning of it is done by the captain, who sits first at the bows of\\nthe sleigh, and is worked by ropes, which he holds in his hands, or by a\\nwheel which controls its movements. In long runs, as on the Schatz-alp\\nat Davos, the wheel is far better than the ropes, since it entails so\\nmuch less strain on the hands of the steersman: on a short run the ropes\\nare as good. Behind the captain sit the members of his crew in line,\\nwith the loops of rope just outside the framework of the sleigh, in\\nwhich they fix their heels. Last of them all sits the brakesman, at the\\nstern of the sleigh, who has in his control a powerful steel-toothed\\nbrake, which crosses the sleigh behind and is worked with levers. But it\\nis the captain who is in command of the bob, and the brakesman and other\\nmembers of the crew only perform his orders. The word “bobsleigh” is\\nderived from the movement of leaning or “bobbing” forward, which is done\\nby all the crew together, to get up speed or increase it. They come\\nforward quickly with a jerk, and go back again slowly and steadily, and\\nthis without doubt accelerates the movement of the sleigh.',\n",

       "  'text': 'As in all other forms of tobogganing, braking is employed to diminish\\nspeed in coming to corners, where otherwise the momentum would cause the\\nwhole concern to leave the track altogether. So also, just as the\\nice-tobogganer inclines his body\\ninwards in a similar position, the captain and crew lean to the inside\\nof the track when going round a corner so as to help the toboggan round\\nit, while the inclination of the front pair of runners is directed to\\nthe same end. By strong leaning inwards, combined with the inclination\\nof the bogie-pair of runners, quite considerable curves may be taken at\\nhigh velocity without the use of the brake at all, and the consequent\\nloss of speed. But all this is left to the judgment of the captain, who\\nhas to decide whether by direction of the bogie-runners alone, or by\\nthat in conjunction with the leaning inwards of his crew, he can safely\\nnegotiate a corner without calling for the use of the brake. And the\\nresponsibility is entirely in his hands. At the same time much depends\\non the prompt obedience of the crew to his orders, for it is easily\\npossible that a corner might have been safely coasted round if they had\\nobeyed his call to lean inwards, which would spill them all if his call\\nwas not immediately responded to. How great the effect of this inward\\nshifting of the weight can be, if it is thoroughly carried out, may be\\nguessed from Plate XXXI. In this same photograph the inward direction of\\nthe front pair of runners may also be seen assisting the work of the\\ncrew. And it is this “teamwork,” the sense of working in unison under\\norders, which gives much of its charm to bobbing. Everyone\\nfeels—rightly—that much of the success of the run depends on his\\nindividual work, even though his individual work is only to lean as far\\nas possible out of the bob without parting company with it\\naltogether.',\n",

The track is then\\niced, for no snow could stand the continual passage of the heavy bobs\\nover the same banks and narrow course without speedily being worn into\\nruts that would entirely spoil the going and upset the goers, and the\\nice is then sprinkled over with loose snow to prevent the toboggan\\nskidding.

For various and intricate as are the manœuvres\\nwhich the expert can perform on skates, and various as are the movements\\nwhich the expert can cause his curling-stones to perform, there is at\\nthe command of the skier a greater expanse of conquerable territory. Not\\nonly has he his figures, so to speak, to cut on the snow-fields, his\\nTelemark and Christiania swings, and his stemming turns, which\\ncorrespond roughly to the threes and rockers and change of edge in the\\nskater’s art, and the outwicks and inwicks of the curler, but he has his\\ntravel over the snows for travel’s sake: he is an artist in climbing,\\nand the whole horizon (omitting such mountain peaks as the Matterhorn or\\nthe Aiguilles) are part of his rink, which reaches, broadly speaking,\\nwherever there is snow. And some part of his rink, however bad the\\nweather, is pretty certain to\\nbe in order. The skater’s rink may be (as has been known within the\\nmemory of man to happen) an inglorious series of pools, or have vanished\\nentirely under a covering of snow, and similarly, the curler’s rink is\\noccasionally found to resemble a sort of cold wet toffee. But the\\nskier’s rink is hardly ever altogether impracticable, and he can both\\ntravel and in his travelling cut his figures. Hardly ever, though he may\\nhave to go far to get it, will he fail, except when a severe fall of\\nsnow is actually going on, to find slopes on which he can at any rate\\n“play about.” Consider also the infinite variety of his tumbles. His\\nfalls are more complicated, have more pleasing uncertainty about them,\\nthan those which any skater can indulge in. Also they hurt far less.\\nThere are few skaters who can manage to fall more than about half a\\ndozen times a day, unless they are exceptionally young, or, as the\\ninquests say, very “well nourished,” and yet continue their practice\\nwith undiminished vigour. But there are few skiers, old or young, lean\\nor otherwise, who will be the least discouraged by twice that number of\\ntumbles.',\n",

It yields him, if he is a novice, a quicker dividend of pleasure\\nthan skating yields to the beginner, or curling to the curler. After a\\nweek’s practice, starting from the beginning, the skater will scarcely\\nyet have felt himself firmly travelling on an outside edge, which, when\\nhe has accomplished it, is after all only the beginning of further\\ntrouble, while the curler, after the same lapse of time, will not have\\nbegun to deliver his stones with the most distant approach to what could\\npossibly be called accuracy. But the\\nskier will already be cognisant of the rapture of sliding swiftly\\ndownhill on the hissing snow, and though the “frequent fall” awaits him,\\nhe will have experienced a genuine taste of the authentic joy. He will,\\ntoo, have climbed high and heavenwards, have seen new horizons spread\\nthemselves, have seen further peaks in the magic of the Alpine air and\\nsunshine rear their austere heads. Stumblingly, perhaps, he will have\\npenetrated into new valleys among the “holy hills,” and felt the\\nsurprise and sting of exploration. He will also, if he has devoted\\nhimself to the tricks—the skating-figures of his art—be appreciably\\nnearer the achievement of stemming turns than the skater will be to the\\naccomplishment of a simple three, or the curler to the hope of coming\\ninto the house round a guard. Thus, if anyone who can get three weeks in\\nSwitzerland, without solid hope of getting more in subsequent years,\\nwere to ask how, being active of body, he could get the maximum of\\nenjoyment out of those three weeks, I should unhesitatingly advise him\\nto practise ski-ing, though, should he have a reasonable prospect of\\ncoming out in future years, I should just as unhesitatingly recommend\\nhim to persevere for a little while, anyhow, with his skates, or stick\\nto the curling-rink if he desires a less hazardous sport. But if he has\\na short holiday, without reasonable prospects of coming out again, I\\nthink if he is young and active he will get more fun in a short time if\\nhe betakes himself to the skis. Moreover, whatever resort he honours\\nwith his presence, he is certain to find there fair ski-ing slopes,\\nespecially in unfavourable weather, and in the vast majority of cases,\\nexcellent ones.

The ski\\nitself, as anyone seeking those altitudes in winter is probably aware,\\nis a long narrow slip of wood turned up at the bows and fastened to his\\nfoot. It is smooth on the under-surface, thicker under the place where\\nhis foot comes than elsewhere, and should have a shallow groove running\\nup the middle of it. In length it should be a few inches shorter than\\nits owner if he stands with his arms outstretched above his head. In\\nother words, a man 6 feet high will want a ski about 7 feet long. This\\nis only a rough-and-ready rule, and if the skier arrives at his Alpine\\nresort with\\nthe intention merely of hiring skis, he should not choose them shorter\\nthan this. It is easier to travel on skis that are too long than on\\nthose which are too short. But, however long the skis are, they cannot\\nbe too narrow. Mr. Caulfield (an adept and authority) lays down that at\\nthe narrowest part (i.e. where the foot rests) they should\\nnever be more than 2¾ inches in breadth. Instantly the novice will\\nexclaim that his boot at the ball of the foot is broader than that, and\\nthat his boot will project beyond the skis. He is perfectly right: it\\nwill. But Mr. Caulfield is right too. He should also see that the grain\\nof the ski lies longitudinally, and that the ski itself is slightly\\narched, the top of the arch lying underneath the wearer’s foot. If the\\nski is quite flat, it will bend downwards in soft snow under the weight\\nand impede the going. These directions, which sound slightly advanced\\nfor him who has never seen a ski at all, are really most elementary. No\\nbeginner should attempt to ski on contraptions that do not fulfil all\\nthese requirements. He might as well begin learning to walk in boots\\nthat are not adapted for ordinary wear.',\n",

They should therefore be strong and\\nlight, and made of cane. They terminate at their lower end in sharp\\nsteel points, and some few inches above those points they should be\\nfitted with a light circular disc of wicker-work which prevents them\\nsinking into the snow. Otherwise the\\nholder, leaning on them, would merely be plunged up to his shoulders in\\nsoft drifts, which would not serve his purpose. They also help to steady\\nhim, in the manner of an ice-axe, when climbing very steep slopes or\\nwhen zigzagging, and should be at least shoulder high. Coming downhill\\nthe beginner, when the pace grows too fast for his liking, is accustomed\\nto lean heavily on them, grasping them together in both hands and making\\nof them a brake to his headlong career. This manœuvre is called\\n“stick-riding,” and is unanimously discouraged by all experts, however\\ndivergent may be their views on the subject of bindings. Later, when the\\nbeginner is joining himself to these austere folk, he will cease to\\nstick-ride, and make stemming-curves and Telemarks and\\nChristiania-swings instead. But as long as the world goes round, and the\\nforce of gravity continues to exercise its accelerating force, so long,\\nwhatever the experts may teach, shall we see the beginner descending a\\nslope, bending low, with eyes starting out of his head in pleasing\\nterror, and leaning heavily on his conjoined sticks.

For on skis you can\\nwith ease climb slopes which are absolutely impossible to the\\npedestrian, since the skier goes unsinking over soft snow and drifts\\nthat would engulf the man in boots as in a frozen quicksand; while in\\ndescents over such places the difference is only emphasised.

He will be standing\\nupright, but leaning forward, which is not a contradiction in terms, if\\nthis phrase is considered. In other words, his whole head, body, and\\nlegs will be inclined a little forward, but he will also be upright\\nbecause there is no bend in his knees or hips or neck. In other words,\\nhe will be standing at right angles to the slope, though leaning\\nforward. His skis will be quite close together, so that they make but\\none track in the snow, and his right foot probably will be a few inches\\nin front of his left. His arms will be a little raised, so that his\\nsticks, which swing pendulum-like from his hands, do not touch the snow,\\nand his descent is that of a stooping hawk.

The coat should be capable of being buttoned closely round the\\nneck, so that in tumbles the snow does not get inside it, and for the\\nsame reason long gloves covering the opening of the sleeves are useful.\\nA woollen cap, of the type known as “crusader,” which can be brought\\nover the ears and neck when encountering cold winds, and be rolled up,\\nwhen so desired, is as good a head-covering as can be devised. Snow\\nspectacles of smoked glass, to shield the eyes from the intense glare,\\nshould always be carried, and put on before (not after) the eyes begin\\nto smart and water from the\\ndazzle of whiteness. Otherwise it is easy to get a touch of\\nsnow-blindness.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The glad word is passed round the hotel one evening that some famous\\nski-jumper has arrived and will give an exhibition next day; and next\\nday, accordingly, you trudge out on to the slope where the jump has been\\nerected. This is a long steep hillside, and the platform for the jump\\nhas been put up some hundred yards from the top of it. It is a champion\\njumper who has arrived, and the apparatus is on the big scale. Out from\\nthe slope of the hill is this platform, built in the manner of a dormer\\nwindow in a house-roof or a header-board above a pool. It is made of\\nwooden planks supported on posts, and covered with a layer of\\ndown-trodden snow. It is some 5 yards or so in length, 5 or 6 feet\\nbroad, and the edge of it is some 6 feet perpendicularly above the slope\\nat its base. At the corners of it, to guide the jumper who approaches\\nit, are\\nboughs of fir stuck into the snow, or flags. Above it the slope is of\\nmoderate steepness, sufficient, anyhow, for a skier to get up a\\nconsiderable speed when running straight down towards it from above;\\nbelow the hillside is considerably steeper, and continues at a steep\\nangle for two or three hundred yards. Both above and below the platform\\nthe snow is being industriously trodden down by those engaged on the\\npreparations, so as to make a smooth firm run for the jumper before he\\ngets to his platform, and a smooth firm landing-place after his flight\\nthrough the air. The reason of this is that it is absolutely essential\\nthat the jumper should have no check when he touches ground again after\\nhis flight: if he landed in soft or deep snow he would quite certainly\\nhave a bad fall. But with hard smooth snow to land on there is no such\\ncheck, and on landing he continues his course at high speed straight\\ndown the hill. It is also extremely important for him to land on a steep\\nslope; for if the slope was but gentle, the shock of coming in contact\\nwith it from such a height would clearly be extremely severe, and broken\\nbones would undoubtedly result. But the steep slope lends itself to the\\npace he is going and the height from which he comes, and, as it were,\\ncontinues his flight on the ground. Also, the steeper the slope is, the\\nlonger obviously will the jump be, as measured from the platform to the\\npoint where he first lands.',\n",

On each side of the course stretch out\\nlines of spectators, and a hundred yards\\nabove the jumper is standing talking to friends and seeming positively\\nto enjoy what lies in front of him. Then the word is given, and,\\nsteadying himself on his two sticks he points his skis straight down\\ntowards the jump. He shoves off with his sticks, leaving them standing\\nin the snow (for no jumper uses sticks when he jumps, which would be\\nhighly dangerous), and at swiftly accelerating speed glides down the\\nslope. As he approaches the jumping-platform he crouches low, and just\\nas he traverses it he springs upwards and forwards into the air. High\\nabove your head, a veritable flying man, he soars, with all the impetus\\nthat his run and his spring have given him. For a hundred feet or more\\nhe continues this amazing flight in a superb curve, and you wait\\nbreathless, scarcely able to believe that when he touches the ground\\nagain at that pace and from that height there will be anything but a\\nheap of broken bones there. But he alights without shock or the least\\nappearance of unsteadiness, and simultaneously, it appears, he is\\nalready another hundred feet down the slope, going like an arrow. Then\\ncomes perhaps the most astounding feat of all: he suddenly kneels, and\\nin a moment has swung round with a Telemark, and has come to rest,\\nfacing up the hillside over which he has flown and skimmed. And then\\nthis extraordinary young man (he is usually rather young) will climb his\\nslope again and instantly repeat the process, in evident enjoyment, or,\\nmore remarkable yet, he will get hold of another like himself, and they\\nwill take their jump hand-in-hand, let go of each other on landing, and\\nTelemark, one to the right the other to the left!',\n",

But he must be\\ncareful to make his movements (his crouch, his spring, his angle in the\\nair, the levelness of his skis as he alights, &c.) with accuracy and\\ncorrect timing; while it is not less important that the jump itself\\nshould be properly constructed and the slopes that lead to and from it\\nbe of suitable steepness. Indeed, what appears to the ignorant onlooker\\nthe most hazardous part of the whole affair, namely, the landing on a\\nvery steep slope, is safe only if the slope is steep, and the real\\nobstacle that lies in the way of most men taking up jumping as a sport,\\nis not that it is dangerous so much as that their nerves tell them that\\nit must be, and refuse to make the crouch and spring (the säts,\\nas the Norwegians call it) with vigour and confidence, even if they can\\nmaster their nerves so far as to let themselves run down on to the\\nplatform at all. But having once reached the platform, the spring must\\nbe made: otherwise the would-be jumper will merely flow stickily, so to\\nspeak, over the edge, bury the toes of his skis in the snow, and\\ncertainly have a bad fall. But, indeed, the nerves must be in good\\ncondition, for the platform, approaching it from above, looks exactly\\nlike a cliff’s edge, and, jutting out as it does from the slope, it\\nentirely conceals the slope below it: your eye tells you that you are\\nmerely leaping over the end of all things. But if, after considering the\\nquestion, you decide, as most people do, that you will not begin jumping\\nthis season, you have only to repeat that prudent resolution for a few\\nmore seasons, and then you will be\\nable to tell yourself and everybody else that it is no use trying to\\nlearn to jump unless you begin it quite as a boy.

       "  'text': 'Of late years the number of the English\\nand other nations who annually go to spend a portion at any rate of the\\nwinter at some High Alpine resort has enormously increased, and in\\nconsequence every year fresh hotels are opened in valleys which hitherto\\nhave hybernated like dormice beneath their snow-laden roofs, during the\\nmonths of short days. But it is by no means every high-perched hotel\\nthat is suitable as a centre for winter sports, for there are several\\nconditions to be considered. In the first place, such a spot must be\\nsufficiently high up to make it probable that there will be fairly\\ncontinuous frosts there throughout the winter, and this again depends\\nnot only on height but also on aspect. As regards height you cannot\\nreasonably depend on getting this continuity of frost (allowing for\\nreasonable breaks) under the height of round about 4000 feet, especially\\nif the place in question is to enjoy long hours of sun. True, an\\nexceptionally severe winter may come, and the strictness of the binding\\nof the frost may hold, week after week, at a much lower altitude, but it\\nis natural that the holiday-maker, who has only a week or two abroad and\\nwants during all his hours of daylight to be employed in sliding\\nmovements, should wish to be fairly safe to find the conditions\\nsuitable, and he has, obviously, a better chance of finding them if\\nhe goes high. But there are several places considerably below this\\n4000-foot level, such as Grindelwald, which lies in a very cold valley,\\nwhere he may in an average year find himself unhampered and rendered\\nidle by thaws, and it is wonderful how continuous frost is at\\nGrindelwald. But there both skating-rink and curling-rink are, all day\\nlong at midwinter, entirely in the shade, for the sun does not rise high\\nenough at noon to look over the great barrier of rock that lies to the\\nsouth of it. That protection, of course, preserves for the place its\\nexcellent ice, whereas if, as at other winter resorts, it basked in the\\nsun all day, the rink would speedily be metamorphosed into a degraded\\nglue with discouraging pools interspersed. But if you go to greater\\nheights, you can combine the pleasures of skating with those of sitting\\nin the sun, and that to this writer is a remarkably charming\\ncombination. But in order to enjoy that you must have greater height\\nthan is possessed by Grindelwald, and a place like Montana, where the\\nsun is on the rink by nine in the morning, and continues to beat down on\\nit till somewhere about five in the afternoon, would see its ice and\\nsnow disappear into slush and torrents of water were it not perched\\nnearly 5000 feet above sea-level. St. Moritz and Mürren are throned\\nhigher yet, and it has to be a very warm winter indeed which will cause\\na general thaw at such places. And there is nothing more irritating than\\nto have gone to some comparatively low place and find that day after day\\ngoes by in melting mood, and at the same time to know that a thousand\\nfeet higher up ideal conditions are being experienced.',\n",

It would be no use at all to spend\\nthe winter on a mountain-top: what is necessary is a\\nhigh sheltered valley, like that of Davos or St. Moritz, or a high\\nsheltered shelf on the mountain-side, like Villars or Mürren. To be able\\nto skate at all, it is necessary that the day should be practically\\nwindless, and quite a gentle breeze spoils it altogether. Moreover, even\\ngentle breezes are currents of moving air above or below freezing-point.\\nIf they are above freezing-point they spell ruin, for they melt both\\nsnow and ice with amazing swiftness; if they are below freezing-point\\nthey feel quite intolerably cold. Therefore, all winter places should be\\nscreened from the wind on the north and east, so that, if such airs are\\nastir, they pass over the valley in which you are, and their icy blasts\\nare unfelt. It does not matter so much whether the valley is screened\\nfrom southerly winds, for this blowing of a southerly wind means in\\nitself that warm currents of air are coming up from the Mediterranean,\\nand as long as that lasts there must be more or less of a thaw, and a\\nscreen to the south almost necessarily implies a cutting off of the sun.\\nThis southerly wind, so justly abhorred by all altitudinists, is\\ngenerally known as the föhn wind. Philologists may try to\\ninterest us in it by telling us that the word is derived from the Latin\\nfavonius, or south wind, but when the föhn blows you\\nare not the least consoled by knowing its derivation: you only wish it\\nhad another destination.

       "  'text': 'So much, then, for the two main conditions—sun (for those who like\\nit) and absence of wind for everybody. And the next prime essential is a\\ngood rink, for out of every hundred people who come\\nout in the winter, it is safe to say that at least eighty either skate\\nor curl. And not only is a good skating-rink necessary, but good skaters\\nalso, for the encouragement and instruction of the learner, and, we may\\nadd, the mutual admiration of each other. But it is extraordinary how a\\ngood rink seems to breed skaters: sooner or later (usually sooner) good\\nskaters are attracted to it, like flies to honey, though we hope they do\\nnot stick in it, and other mere beginners rapidly develop into sound\\nperformers. The Davos rink developed skaters thus, and more recently the\\nimmense rink at Villars has brought to birth a whole fresh school of\\nEnglish skating. The writer is tempted to be anecdotal. Not more than\\nsix or seven years ago he first went there and found that the only\\nskating-rink was one flooded lawn-tennis court. On it the most\\naccomplished skater in the place was instructing and demonstrating to\\ntwo pupils. She was showing them the change of edge, and as, perhaps a\\nlittle falteringly, she passed from one edge to the other she\\nproclaimed: “The change from the outside edge to the inside is possible,\\nbut the change from the inside to the outside is impossible.” Indeed\\nthat would save an infinity of trouble to many of us, if we thought it\\nwas strictly true. But Villars made up its mind otherwise, and nowadays\\nthe great rink, which would hold hundreds of lawn-tennis courts, holds\\nhundreds of skaters also who demonstrate the falsity of that sublime\\npronouncement.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Now ice varies enormously, not only in smoothness or roughness of\\nsurface, but in texture and in hardness, and without doubt the\\npleasantest and at the same time the easiest ice to skate on is\\nthat which has been frozen at temperatures not unreasonably low. Should\\nthe thermometer have stood all night at zero or below, the ice made\\nunder that benumbing influence will be both very hard and rather\\nbrittle; whereas if the rink had basked in a mellow moonlight of say 10\\nor 15 degrees of frost, the ice, though perfectly solid and dry, will be\\nfar kinder to the skate blade and lend itself more amenably to the\\nedges. Indeed, after a very cold night, the ice is absolutely\\nunskateable on until the sun has relaxed its adamantine rigidity; the\\nedges of the skate will not bite. This appears to be due to the amazing\\nfact, not generally known, that the skate actually moves over a thin\\nlayer of water, which its passage, its weight and friction causes to be\\nmomentarily produced. This transient, minute and local thaw (which\\ninstantaneously ceases in the wake of the skate) does not take place\\nwhen the temperature is abnormally cold, and, in consequence, the skate,\\ninstead of travelling smoothly and firmly, cannot be prevented from\\nskidding on the marble-like and uncuttable surface, and even when the\\nsun has to some extent mitigated this hardness, the ice tends to be\\nbrittle and unkind. Thus, since in very high places there are recorded a\\nlarge number of very low temperatures, the skater will probably find\\npleasanter ice at lower altitudes. Much, of course, depends on the\\nmaking of it, and the whole question perhaps may be regarded as\\ntrifling, but in the writer’s opinion the resorts at which, as a rule,\\nvery low temperatures do not occur, yield the greatest abundance of\\njolly ice. On the other hand, the higher the place, the greater is the\\nprobability of immunity from thaws.',\n",

The ski-ing also is much better there than at\\nthat place. St. Moritz and all these other smaller centres are fortunate\\nin the number of hours of sun that they enjoy: they are less fortunate\\nin the wind that rather frequently blows up from the Maloja pass, a\\nchilly and disconcerting current of air that not very infrequently\\nstarts to blow shortly after mid-day. But there is probably no place in\\nSwitzerland which enjoys a larger proportion of perfect winter days, and\\nin none are the rinks more carefully made and preserved. It was one of\\nthe earliest places in which the pursuit of winter sport began to\\ndevelop, and from the earliest days the St. Moritz school of English\\nskating was renowned for the strictness of its requirements. Of late\\nyears the International style has greatly developed there, owing\\nprobably to the very large number of German visitors who annually go\\nthere. But there is enough ice for everybody, since many of the hotels\\nhave private skating-rinks of their own, and there is no reason why the\\ntwo schools should not flourish side by side. Just round about St.\\nMoritz itself there is not any very extraordinary display of Alpine\\nscenery, for the larger peaks are not visible therefrom. But there are,\\nin addition to the winter sports already mentioned, innumerable\\nexcursions to be made, and the lake-skating, when the chronology of\\nsnow-fall and frost is propitious, is a tremendous though usually a\\nshort-lived attraction. The journey from England can be luxuriously made\\nin the Engadine express, which reaches St. Moritz in the middle of the\\nday after which the voyager has left London.',\n",

Above the town is a lake of\\nconsiderable extent, on which occasional skating can be had. But a\\ncommoner phenomenon than the skater on that lake are the horse-drawn\\nsledges which are loaded with solid blocks of ice sawn out of the frozen\\nsurface and taken away to make puddings with instead of figures on.

Nor is this to be wondered\\nat, for, apart from the excellence of its provisions for all manner of\\nwinter sports, Villars, set in its pine-woods and faced by the splendid\\nopen view across the valley, is possessed of an extraordinary charm of\\nsituation and natural beauty.',\n",

It is reached by\\nan amazing funicular from Sierre, and is 4900 feet above sea-level.\\nBehind and above it and around it stretch limitless ski-ing slopes, and\\nthere are any amount of expeditions to be made from it. There are two\\ngood rinks: one for curlers, another for skaters; and after a\\nconsiderable period of Laodicean apathy, Montana seems to have made up\\nits mind to be of the English school. But up till lately it had put its\\nchief energies into ski-ing and curling, and had not pursued skating in\\nthat tense and scientific spirit which it deserves. There is a fairly\\ngood artificial ice-run for toboggans, and another snow-run down\\nvalleywards, and plenty of those quiet, hard-trodden paths down which\\nthe amateur tobogganer likes to ramble. There are two\\nlakes which, when the snow has made an agreeable arrangement with the\\nfrost, can be used for skating, and in summer, when the sun has come to\\nan understanding with the snow, a fine golf-course is found to reveal\\nitself. But all winter long the sun blazes on Montana, while its\\naltitude and the cold of its nights preserves its frozen mantle. Of the\\nview I have already spoken: there is something to be said for a view in\\nthe intervals of falling-down, and in the meditation and quiescence\\nwhich such falls sometimes entail.',\n",

As will be readily\\nunderstood, the ice over which a hockey match has been played is\\nperfectly useless for skaters any more that day until it has been swept,\\nscraped, and sprinkled or flooded; and in consequence, at all Swiss\\nresorts, with the exception of St. Moritz, where there is a rink that\\nhas been made for the hockey-player, or when an important match is being\\nplayed, this sport is supplementary to such others as I have spoken of.\\nNobody, that is, plays hockey and nothing else, since he cannot play\\nhockey at all till the greedy skaters have finished with the ice.',\n",

The finer the team, as is always the case, the\\ngreater is their interdependence on each other, and the less there is of\\nindividual play. Brilliant running and dribbling, indeed, you will see;\\nbut as distinguished from a side composed of individuals, however good,\\nwho are yet not a team, these brilliant episodes are always part of a\\nplan, and end not in some wild shot but in a pass or a succession of\\npasses, designed to lead to a good opening for scoring. There is,\\nindeed, no game at which team play outwits individual brilliance so\\ncompletely.\", \"For the rest, everybody knows the \\u201csort of thing\\u201d hockey is, and\\nquite rightly supposes that ice-hockey is the same \\u201csort of thing\\u201d\\nplayed on a field of ice by performers shod in skates. As is natural,\\nthe practice and ability which enable a man to play ordinary hockey with\\nmoderate success are a large factor in his success when he woos the more\\nelusive sister-sport; another factor, and one which is not sufficiently\\nappreciated, is the strength of his skating. It is not enough to be able\\nto run very swiftly on the skates: no one is an ice-hockey player of the\\nlowest grade who cannot turn quickly to right or left, start quickly,\\nand above all, stop quickly. However swift a player may be, he is\\npractically useless to his side unless he can, with moderate suddenness,\\ncheck his headlong career, turn quickly, and when the time comes again\\nstart quickly.\"]]}\n"
